  "longBio": "I'm a Full Stack Developer with over 2 years of experience building web applications that don't just work — they scale, survive, and sometimes even impress. My main tools are JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, Node.js, and cloud services (because what's life without a little server crash at midnight?). I've helped launch platforms like Lit Law and Lit Sign, integrating AI into real-world workflows and handling everything from backend architecture to CMS migrations. When I'm not shipping production code or battling merge conflicts, you'll find me experimenting with new tech, competing in coding challenges, or pretending that side projects don't take over my weekends. I believe in writing clean code, learning constantly, and occasionally arguing with my rubber duck debugger.",
